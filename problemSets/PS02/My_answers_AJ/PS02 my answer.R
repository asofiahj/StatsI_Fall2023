#drinking water facilities in the villages, I formulated the null and

# H0: The reservation policy of a GP for women leaders has no effect on the number of new or 
#repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.
  
# H1: The reservation policy of a GP for women leaders has an effect on the number of new or

# regression results
summary(model)


# In summary, this regression analysis indicates that the gender of the council 
# head (female or male) is statistically significant in explaining the number of
#new or repaired drinking water facilities. When the council head is female, 
# there is on average an estimated increase of 7.864 facilities compared to when
# the council head is male, although the effect size is relatively small.
#The relationship is significant but explains only a small portion of the 
# variance in the outcome variable.

#Residual Standard Error:
#The residual standard error is 33.51, which indicates the typical error in 
#predicting the number of drinking water facilities based on the model. Smaller
#values would indicate a better fit.

# The coefficient estimate for "reserved" is 9.252.
# The "reserved" coefficient (9.252) represents the estimated change in the 
# output variable "water" (the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities)
# when a GP is reserved for women leaders compared to when it is not reserved.
# In this context, it means that reserving the GP is associated with an estimated
# increase of on average 9.252 in the number of new or repaired drinking water 
# facilities compared to when GP is not reserved for women.
# The coefficient is positive, which suggests that the reservation policy is 
# associated with more drinking water facilities. This coefficient is 
# statistically significant, as indicated by the asterisk (*), with a p-value 
# of 0.0197. This means that the relationship between reservation policies and the
# number of drinking water facilities is unlikely to be due to chance.
